# Examples

## Example 1: FastSurfer Docker
After pulling one of our images from Dockerhub, you do not need to have a separate installation of FreeSurfer on your computer (it is already included in the Docker image). However, if you want to run ___more than just the segmentation CNN___, you need to register at the FreeSurfer website (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/registration.html) to acquire a valid license for free. The directory containing the license needs to be mounted and passed to the script via the `--fs_license` flag. Basically for Docker (as for Singularity below) you are starting a container image (with the run command) and pass several parameters for that, e.g. if GPUs will be used and mounting (linking) the input and output directories to the inside of the container image. In the second half of that call you pass parameters to our run_fastsurfer.sh script that runs inside the container (e.g. where to find the FreeSurfer license file, and the input data and other flags). 

To run FastSurfer on a given subject using the provided GPU-Docker, execute the following command:

```bash
# 1. get the fastsurfer docker image (if it does not exist yet)
docker pull deepmi/fastsurfer 

# 2. Run command
docker run --gpus all -v /home/user/my_mri_data:/data \
                      -v /home/user/my_fastsurfer_analysis:/output \
                      -v /home/user/my_fs_license_dir:/fs_license \
                      --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) deepmi/fastsurfer:latest \
                      --fs_license /fs_license/license.txt \
                      --t1 /data/subjectX/t1-weighted.nii.gz \
                      --sid subjectX --sd /output \
                      --parallel --3T
```

Docker Flags:
* The `--gpus` flag is used to allow Docker to access GPU resources. With it, you can also specify how many GPUs to use. In the example above, _all_ will use all available GPUS. To use a single one (e.g. GPU 0), set `--gpus device=0`. To use multiple specific ones (e.g. GPU 0, 1 and 3), set `--gpus 'device=0,1,3'`.
* The `-v` commands mount your data, output, and directory with the FreeSurfer license file into the docker container. Inside the container these are visible under the name following the colon (in this case /data, /output, and /fs_license). 
* The `--rm` flag takes care of removing the container once the analysis finished. 
* The `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)` part automatically runs the container with your group- (id -g) and user-id (id -u). All generated files will then belong to the specified user. Without the flag, the docker container will be run as root which is discouraged.

FastSurfer Flag:
* The `--fs_license` points to your FreeSurfer license which needs to be available on your computer in the my_fs_license_dir that was mapped above. 
* The `--t1` points to the t1-weighted MRI image to analyse (full path, with mounted name inside docker: /home/user/my_mri_data => /data)
* The `--sid` is the subject ID name (output folder name)
* The `--sd` points to the output directory (its mounted name inside docker: /home/user/my_fastsurfer_analysis => /output)
* The `--parallel` activates processing left and right hemisphere in parallel
* The `--3T` changes the atlas for registration to the 3T atlas for better Talairach transforms and ICV estimates (eTIV)

Note, that the paths following `--fs_license`, `--t1`, and `--sd` are __inside__ the container, not global paths on your system, so they should point to the places where you mapped these paths above with the `-v` arguments (part after colon). 

A directory with the name as specified in `--sid` (here subjectX) will be created in the output directory if it does not exist. So in this example output will be written to /home/user/my_fastsurfer_analysis/subjectX/ . Make sure the output directory is empty, to avoid overwriting existing files. 

If you do not have a GPU, you can also run our CPU-Docker by dropping the `--gpus all` flag and specifying `--device cpu` at the end as a FastSurfer flag, see also [FastSurfer's docker documentation](../../Docker/README.md) for more details.

## Example 2: FastSurfer Singularity
After building the Singularity image (see below or [these instructions](../../Singularity/README.md)), you also need to register at the FreeSurfer website (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/registration.html) to acquire a valid license (for free) - same as when using Docker. This license needs to be passed to the script via the `--fs_license` flag. This is not necessary if you want to run the segmentation only.

To run FastSurfer on a given subject using the Singularity image with GPU access, execute the following commands from a directory where you want to store singularity images. This will create a singularity image from our Dockerhub image and execute it:

```bash
# 1. Build the singularity image (if it does not exist)
singularity build fastsurfer-gpu.sif docker://deepmi/fastsurfer

# 2. Run command
singularity exec --nv \
                 --no-home \
                 -B /home/user/my_mri_data:/data \
                 -B /home/user/my_fastsurfer_analysis:/output \
                 -B /home/user/my_fs_license_dir:/fs_license \
                 ./fastsurfer-gpu.sif \
                 /fastsurfer/run_fastsurfer.sh \
                 --fs_license /fs_license/license.txt \
                 --t1 /data/subjectX/t1-weighted.nii.gz \
                 --sid subjectX --sd /output \
                 --parallel --3T
```

### Singularity Flags
* The `--nv` flag is used to access GPU resources. 
* The `--no-home` flag stops mounting your home directory into singularity.
* The `-B` commands mount your data, output, and directory with the FreeSurfer license file into the Singularity container. Inside the container these are visible under the name following the colon (in this case /data, /output, and /fs_license). 

### FastSurfer Flags
* The `--fs_license` points to your FreeSurfer license which needs to be available on your computer in the my_fs_license_dir that was mapped above. 
* The `--t1` points to the t1-weighted MRI image to analyse (full path, with mounted name inside docker: /home/user/my_mri_data => /data)
* The `--sid` is the subject ID name (output folder name)
* The `--sd` points to the output directory (its mounted name inside docker: /home/user/my_fastsurfer_analysis => /output)
* The `--parallel` activates processing left and right hemisphere in parallel
* The `--3T` changes the atlas for registration to the 3T atlas for better Talairach transforms and ICV estimates (eTIV)

Note, that the paths following `--fs_license`, `--t1`, and `--sd` are __inside__ the container, not global paths on your system, so they should point to the places where you mapped these paths above with the `-v` arguments (part after colon).

A directory with the name as specified in `--sid` (here subjectX) will be created in the output directory. So in this example output will be written to /home/user/my_fastsurfer_analysis/subjectX/ . Make sure the output directory is empty, to avoid overwriting existing files. 

You can run the Singularity equivalent of CPU-Docker by building a Singularity image from the CPU-Docker image and excluding the `--nv` argument in your Singularity exec command. Also append `--device cpu` as a FastSurfer flag.


## Example 3: Native FastSurfer on subjectX with parallel processing of hemis

For a native install you may want to make sure that you are on our stable branch, as the default dev branch is for development and could be broken at any time. For that you can directly clone the stable branch:

```bash
git clone --branch stable https://github.com/Deep-MI/FastSurfer.git
```

More details (e.g. you need all dependencies in the right versions and also FreeSurfer locally) can be found in our [Installation guide](INSTALL.md).
Given you want to analyze data for subject which is stored on your computer under /home/user/my_mri_data/subjectX/t1-weighted.nii.gz, run the following command from the console (do not forget to source FreeSurfer!):

```bash
# Source FreeSurfer
export FREESURFER_HOME=/path/to/freesurfer
source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.sh

# Define data directory
datadir=/home/user/my_mri_data
fastsurferdir=/home/user/my_fastsurfer_analysis

# Run FastSurfer
./run_fastsurfer.sh --t1 $datadir/subjectX/t1-weighted-nii.gz \
                    --sid subjectX --sd $fastsurferdir \
                    --parallel --threads 4 --3T
```

The output will be stored in the $fastsurferdir (including the aparc.DKTatlas+aseg.deep.mgz segmentation under $fastsurferdir/subjectX/mri (default location)). Processing of the hemispheres will be run in parallel (--parallel flag) to significantly speed-up surface creation. Omit this flag to run the processing sequentially, e.g. if you want to save resources on a compute cluster.


## Example 4: FastSurfer on multiple subjects

In order to run FastSurfer on multiple cases, you may use the helper script `brun_subjects.sh`. This script accepts multiple ways to define the subjects, for example a subjects_list file.
Prepare the subjects_list file as follows (one line subject per line; delimited by `\n`):
```
subject_id1=path_to_t1
subject2=path_to_t1
subject3=path_to_t1
...
subject10=path_to_t1
```
Note, that all paths (`path_to_t1`) are as if you passed them to the `run_fastsurfer.sh` script via `--t1 <path>` so they may be with respect to the singularity or docker file system. Absolute paths are recommended. 

The `brun_fastsurfer.sh` script can then be invoked in docker, singularity or on the native platform as follows:

### Docker
```bash
docker run --gpus all -v /home/user/my_mri_data:/data \
                      -v /home/user/my_fastsurfer_analysis:/output \
                      -v /home/user/my_fs_license_dir:/fs_license \
                      --entrypoint "/fastsurfer/brun_fastsurfer.sh" \
                      --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) deepmi/fastsurfer:latest \
                      --fs_license /fs_license/license.txt \
                      --sd /output --subject_list /data/subjects_list.txt \
                      --parallel --3T
```
### Singularity
```bash
singularity exec --nv \
                 --no-home \
                 -B /home/user/my_mri_data:/data \
                 -B /home/user/my_fastsurfer_analysis:/output \
                 -B /home/user/my_fs_license_dir:/fs_license \
                 ./fastsurfer-gpu.sif \
                 /fastsurfer/brun_fastsurfer.sh \
                 --fs_license /fs_license/license.txt \
                 --sd /output \
                 --subject_list /data/subjects_list.txt \
                 --parallel --3T
```
### Native
```bash
export FREESURFER_HOME=/path/to/freesurfer
source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.sh

cd /home/user/FastSurfer
datadir=/home/user/my_mri_data
fastsurferdir=/home/user/my_fastsurfer_analysis

# Run FastSurfer
./brun_fastsurfer.sh --subject_list $datadir/subjects_list.txt \
                     --sd $fastsurferdir \
                     --parallel --threads 4 --3T
```

### Flags
The `brun_fastsurfer.sh` script accepts almost all `run_fastsurfer.sh` flags (exceptions are `--t1` and `--sid`). In addition, 
* the `--parallel_subjects` runs all subjects in parallel (experimental, parameter may change in future releases). This is particularly useful for surfaces computation `--surf_only`.
* to run segmentation in series, but surfaces in parallel, you may use `--parallel_subjects surf`.
* these options are in contrast (and in addition) to `--parallel`, which just parallelizes the hemispheres of one case.

## Example 5: Quick Segmentation

For many applications you won't need the surfaces. You can run only the aparc+DKT segmentation (in 1 minute on a GPU) via

```bash
./run_fastsurfer.sh --t1 $datadir/subject1/t1-weighted.nii.gz \
                    --asegdkt_segfile $outputdir/subject1/aparc.DKTatlas+aseg.deep.mgz \
                    --conformed_name $outputdir/subject1/conformed.mgz \
                    --threads 4 --seg_only --no_cereb
```

This will produce the segmentation in a conformed space (just as FreeSurfer would do). It also writes the conformed image that fits the segmentation.
Conformed means that the image will be isotropic in LIA orientation. 
It will furthermore output a brain mask (`mri/mask.mgz`), a simplified segmentation file (`mri/aseg.auto_noCCseg.mgz`), the biasfield corrected image (`mri/orig_nu.mgz`), and the volume statistics (without eTIV) based on the FastSurferVINN segmentation (without the corpus callosum) (`stats/aseg+DKT.stats`).

If you do not even need the biasfield corrected image and the volume statistics, you may add `--no_biasfield`. These steps especially benefit from larger assigned core counts `--threads 32`.

The above ```run_fastsurfer.sh``` commands can also be called from the Docker or Singularity images by passing the flags and adjusting input and output directories to the locations inside the containers (where you mapped them via the -v flag in Docker or -B in Singularity). 

```bash
# Docker
docker run --gpus all -v $datadir:/data \
                      -v $outputdir:/output \
                      --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) deepmi/fastsurfer:latest \
                      --t1 /data/subject1/t1-weighted.nii.gz \
                      --asegdkt_segfile /output/subject1/aparc.DKTatlas+aseg.deep.mgz \
                      --conformed_name $outputdir/subject1/conformed.mgz \
                      --threads 4 --seg_only --3T
```

## Example 6: Running FastSurfer on a SLURM cluster via Singularity

Starting with version 2.2, FastSurfer comes with a script that helps orchestrate FastSurfer optimally on a SLURM cluster: `srun_fastsurfer.sh`.

This script distributes GPU-heavy and CPU-heavy workloads to different SLURM partitions and manages intermediate files in a work directory for IO performance.

```bash
srun_fastsurfer.sh --partition seg=GPU_Partition \
                   --partition surf=CPU_Partition \
                   --sd $outputdir \
                   --data $datadir \
                   --singularity_image $HOME/images/fastsurfer-singularity.sif \
                   [...] # fastsurfer flags
```

This will create three dependent SLURM jobs, one to segment, one for surface reconstruction and one for cleanup (which moves the data from the work directory to the `$outputdir`).
There are many intricacies and options, so it is advised to use `--help`, `--debug` and `--dry` to inspect, what will be scheduled as well as run a test on a small subset. More control over subjects is available with `--subject_list`.

The `$outputdir` and the `$datadir` need to be accessible from cluster nodes. Most IO is performed on a work directory (automatically generated from `$HPCWORK` environment variable: `$HPCWORK/fastsurfer-processing/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)`). Alternatively, an empty directory can be manually defined via `--work`. On successful cleanup, this directory will be removed.
