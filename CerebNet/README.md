# CerebNet
Deep learning based tool for segmentation of cerebellar sub-regions.

The training and evaluation scripts of CerebNet are currently not part of the FastSurfer repository and are only available as incompatible stubs from the authors on request via email.
The interface to realistic deformations can be found in :py:`CerebNet.apply_warp`.
