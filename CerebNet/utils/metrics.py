            For example, to compute arithmetic mean value, `op = lambda a, x: a + x`.
        output_transform (callable, optional): a callable that is used to transform the
            :class:`~ignite.engine.Engine`'s `process_function`'s output into the
            form expected by the metric. This can be useful if, for example, you have a multi-output model and
            you want to compute the metric with respect to one of the outputs.
        device (str of torch.device, optional): device specification in case of distributed computation usage.

    Computes the (symmetric) Hausdorff Distance (HD) between the binary objects in two

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : array_like
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.
    reference : array_like
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.
    voxelspacing : float or sequence of floats, optional
        The voxelspacing in a distance unit i.e. spacing of elements
        along each dimension. If a sequence, must be of length equal to
        the input rank; if a single number, this is used for all axes. If
        not specified, a grid spacing of unity is implied.

        The neighbourhood/connectivity considered when determining the surface
        of the binary objects. This value is passed to
