# File: quicktest.yaml

# Created on: 2023-07-10
# Functionality: This workflow runs FastSurfer on MRI data and runs pytest to check if the results are acceptable. It
#  also checks if the FastSurfer environment and output already exist, and if not, it creates them.
# Usage: This workflow is triggered on a pull request to the dev and main branch. It can also be triggered manually
#  with workflow-dispatch.
# Expected/Used Environment Variables:
#  - MAMBAPATH: Path to the micromamba binary.
#  - MAMBAROOT: Root path for micromamba.
#  - RUNNER_FS_OUTPUT: Path to the directory where FastSurfer output is stored.
#  - RUNNER_FS_MRI_DATA: Path to the directory where MRI data is stored.
#  - FREESURFER_HOME: Path to the freesurfer directory.
#  - FS_LICENSE: Path to the FreeSurfer license file.
