# Functionality: This workflow runs some quick integration tests on FastSurfer commits. It checks out the new
#                FastSurfer repo, sets up Python, builds a Singularity image, runs FastSurfer on sample MRI data, and
#                runs pytest to check if the results are acceptable
# Usage: This workflow is exclusively triggered manually with workflow-dispatch in DeepMI/FastSurfer.
